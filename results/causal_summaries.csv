unit 2 was stationary in the northbound lane at the red light of the 600 block of s. texas blvd. unit 1 was traveling north at the 600 block of s. texas blvd. unit 1 failed to control speed and struck unit 2 on the back end. unit 1 sustained damage to the front end.,"Unit 1 failed to control its speed, causing it to strike Unit 2 from behind. The failure was due to a lack of proper braking or acceleration management by Unit 1's driver."
***bwc available***unit 1 was traveling w/b at the 6000 block of lyndon b johnson fwy on the second lane from the left and unit 2 was traveling w/b on the 6000 block of lyndon b johnson fwy on the second lane from the left directly infront of unit 1.unit 1 failed to control speed and collided with unit 2.unit 1's fd collided with unit 2's bd.,"Unit 1 failed to control its speed, leading to a collision with Unit 2. The root cause was Unit 1's inability to maintain a safe speed for the conditions."
unit 2 (nissan kicks) was traveling e in the left lane of eb 900 harris just e of 900 pasadena blvd. unit 1 was facing n along the s curb of 900 harris just e of unit 2. unit 1 was in a private drive waiting with the intent of turning w onto harris. unit 1 began traveling n while failing to yield the right of way from a private drive and collided with unit 2 as unit 2 passed. driver unit 1 claimed to have simply not seen unit 2. approx aoi was 60' e of the e curb of 900 pasadena blvd and 13' n of the s curb of 900 harris.,"Unit 1 failed to yield the right-of-way from a private drive, colliding with Unit 2 as it passed. This failure was due to Unit 1's driver not seeing Unit 2, resulting in a lack of awareness and control."
"unit 2 was traveling eb on spencer hwy, at the 6400 block, in the #2 lane. unit 1 was traveling wb on spencer hwy, at the 6500 block, in the #2 lane. unit 1 attempted to change lanes and when they did, unit 1's back left tire detached from the vehicle.â  the loose tire continued to roll wbâ on spencer hwy at a high rate of speed, through the denkman st intersection, and the tire then crashed into unit 2.unit 2 attempted to avoid the tire but the traffic on the roadway prevented him from maneuvering away from the imminent impact.the aoi was approximately 20 ft n of the scl of the 6400 block of spencer hwy and approx. 20 ft w of the wcl of the 3000 block of denkman st.","The back left tire detached from Unit 1's vehicle due to a failure, allowing it to continue rolling westbound on Spencer Hwy at high speed. The tire failed because it was not properly secured or maintained, leading to its detachment during the lane change maneuver."
"unit 2 was idled at the stop sign at the intersection of ebony st & nolana loop, facing southbound. unit 1 was idled behind unit 2. unit 1 failed to control speed thus with its front distributed struck unit 2 back distributed.","Unit 1's failure to control speed caused it to strike the rear of Unit 2 due to excessive velocity. The root cause is Unit 1's inability to maintain a safe speed for the given conditions, leading to loss of control."
"v1 is ford pick truck with disabling damage. v2 is blue tesla with disabling damage. v3 is a ford pick up truck with minor damage. v1 was driving northbound on mccreary. v2 was driving eastbound in the number three lane. eastbound traffic had the green light so v2 continued through the intersection. v1 struck v2. v1 had a ladder attached and during the collision it partially became detached from the vehicle and struck v3, who was in the south bound lanes of mccreary. operator of v3 watched the collision occur due to him waiting for to make a left hand turn. he advised that v2 eastbound traffic had the green light and was already moving. v1 was speeding to try and get through the intersection.","V1, traveling at excessive speed, failed to yield to V2's green light, colliding with it due to its own reckless driving behavior. The collision was exacerbated by the partially detached ladder from V1, which then struck V3 in the southbound lanes."
"unit 2 was traveling wb on curtis ave. as unit 2 approached the pasadena blvd intersection she had a steady green so unit 1 entered the intersection in order to continue wb on curtis ave. unit 1 was traveling nb on pasadena blvd, at theâ 1500 block, in the #1 lane. the method of traffic control at this intersection has changed recently from a two-way stop sign to a signal light. unit 1 forgot about the newly installed signal light, ran the red light, entered the intersection, and crashed into unit 2.the aoi was approximately 20 ft w of the ecl of the 1500 block of pasadena blvd and approx. 10 ft s of the ncl of the 1000 block of curtis ave.","Unit 1 failed to recognize or obey the newly installed traffic signal, causing them to run a red light and crash into Unit 2.

The root cause was Unit #1's inability to maintain a safe following distance or slow down in time to avoid the stopped traffic ahead."
"unit #2 was traveling e/b in the #1 lane of 5800 fairmont pkwy approaching the intersection of 4000 fairway plaza dr on a green light.unit #1 was traveling n/b in the #1 lane of 4000 fairway plaza dr and ran the red light at the intersection of 5800 fairmont pkwy, causing unit #2 to collide with unit #1 (aoi : fd-lbq).driver of unit #1 stated that she saw the second light for fairmont pkwy w/b was green, and mistook that her light was red.see geo coordinates for aoi.","The root cause of the crash was the driver of unit #1 misinterpreting the traffic signal as being red when it was actually green due to a visual error. The traffic signal itself failed to provide clear indication, allowing the driver to proceed through the intersection."
unit 1 was wb in the 5600 blk of w ih 20 exiting onto the nsr.  unit 2 was behind unit 1.  unit 1 began to slow to merge onto the service road.  unit 2 was following too close resulting in unit 1 br and unit 2 fl colliding.,"Unit 2 failed to maintain a safe following distance, causing a rear-end collision with Unit 1 as it slowed to merge onto the service road.

Unit 1 failed to maintain a safe following distance, colliding with Unit 2 after its driver's side door was partially open due to an attempt by Unit 2's driver to allow bees to exit. The partial opening of the door created a hazard that Unit 1 failed to anticipate and respond to in time."
"unit #1 was traveling westbound on w, 2ns street approaching the 4000 block.  the driver advised that the vehicle was set to automated (auto-pilot) mode.  driver advised that he reached down to grab his phone which fell and the next thing he knew was that his vehicle had left the northern edge of the roadway.  unit #1 appears to have driven over at least 2 culverts and striking a road sign causing extensive damage to the front left, front right, front windshield and rear right side of the vehicle.","The root cause was the driver's inattention while operating in automated mode, which allowed the vehicle to leave the roadway. The failure was the driver's distraction by reaching for his phone, leading to a loss of situational awareness and control of the vehicle."
